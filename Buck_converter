This work presents a DC-DC buck converter to convert the voltage from 3.3V to 2.1V, widely used in lowvoltage applications. The buck converter works on the principle
of PWM(Pulse Width Modulation). The transistor acts as a switch that connects and disconnects alternatively to the inductor with a duty cycle of 0.63. The current flow 
path and the time decide the capacitor charging, in turn, the output voltage. To stabilize the output, feedback is applied with an error amplifier, comparator,
and driver circuits. Performance parameters are calculated for the proposed design which includes a Line transient of 160mV,a Constant load transient as ideal, and a step 
response in a few milliseconds. The DC-DC Buck Converter design and layout are implemented in 180nm CMOS technology.
